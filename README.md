# Form_Image_to_LIVE_FORM
It's a code which can be used to convert a picture of form into a real form.
I have used Python language to write the code.
This code additionally uses opencv, html, css and numpy for processing.
HOW THE CODE WORKS:
1. First it takes the image which has to be processed.
2. Detects the corners(sharp points) in the images.
3. Removes the unwanted sharp points got from letters.
4. Analyses the corners.
5. Then it goes for checking what type of entry the form is needed like(name, password, email, some file from your computer or date, etc....).
                and now it got everything needed
                     THE FORM IS READY
